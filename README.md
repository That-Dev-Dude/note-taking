## Developing

This project is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), an incredible tool for bundling front end code. Checkout their docs to learn more, but the general synopsis is; it's really, really fast.

When the dev server is running, it will constantly be running ESLint and the TypeScript compiler on every save. If there is an issue, you will see the issue in the terminal and in the browser. Just like create-react-app.

These errors **cannot be dismissed**, as they are integral to the integrity of the app.

## Testing

I have not done any tests :slightly_frowning_face:

They take a considerable amount of time to do correctly, and it wasn't worth it for this.

## Runtime Libraries Used

- [@mui/material](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/) ( Material UI )
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started)

## Tooling Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Styling

Styling was done with [MUI v5](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/). There have been significant changes to this library, and overriding base styles has never been easier.

Some benefits of using v5 have been documented on [their blog](https://mui.com/blog/mui-core-v5/).
